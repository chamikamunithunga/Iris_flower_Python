## Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample characterized by four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to classify the iris flowers into their respective species based on these features.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
